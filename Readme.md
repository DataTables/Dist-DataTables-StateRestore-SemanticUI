# StateRestore for DataTables with Fomantic UI styling

StateRestore is a state management UI for DataTables. It allows users to create multiple table states which can be saved and then reloaded at any time. This is particularly useful for complex tables where specific views are common and the user might wish to toggle between states.

States can be saved locally, or for a more permanent part of your table's features, to a remote database via Ajax, which also provides the ability for users to share states.

For full information about StateRestore including its features and configuration option, please [refer to the DataTables manual](https://datatables.net/manual/extensions/staterestore/).
